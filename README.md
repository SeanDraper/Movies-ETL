# Movies ETL

## Overview

In this project we will be creating an automated pipline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables for our client Britta and Amazing Prime. This project will be broken down into four deliverables: ETL_function_test.ipynb that writes and ETL function to read three data files, ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb that extracts and transforms the Wikipedia data, ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb that extracts and transforms the Kaggle data, and finally ETL_create_database.ipynb that creates the movite database.
